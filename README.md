# Autonomous-and-Mobile-Robotics-project
in this project we exploited the turtlebot3 burger robot understanding how to make it able to autonomously plan, navigate 
and localize itself by using the Robotics Operating System (ROS).
## First Task
At the beginning, we set Gazebo and RViz to simulate the physical behavior of the robot and to start the visualization of 
what the robot sees through the lidar.
In order to run it, do the following command in the project folder:
'''catkin_make'''
source the package installation:
'''source devel/setup.bash'''
